# bleuMeasure
BLEU - a machine translation evaluation metric
This is an implementation of the original paper on BLEU score by Kishore Papineni, Salim Roukos, Todd Ward, and Wei-Jing Zhu.
A minor modification includes the precision metric which is applied a laplace smoothing to avoid vanishing of bleu score.
